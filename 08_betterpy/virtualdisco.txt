2021-09-30

What is?
venv means virtul environment. It is a directory that contains a copy of python. 
The directory comes with pip, allowing the user to download python libraries as well. 
The command "$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero" creates a virtual environment in the myherozero directory. 
The myherozero/bin directory has all the pip and python directories. 

Why use?
Virtual environments allow the user to work on seaprate python projects without haveing to worry about using the right versions of libraries.
Without virtual environments, the user might have to delete and redownload different versions of libraries. 

How use?
Virtual environments can be activated by running `$ source env/bin/activate`.
Activating a virtual environment changes the $PATH of the terminal.
To deactivate the virtual environment, run $ deactivate.
