- Homepage: Has login in button and search bar
	- Requires flask form work and templating
	- where the user logs out from
- Log In Page: Allows user to login in order to post. Failure returns to home page
	- Needs a template
	- Requires flask form work to collect input 
	- Will likely need to reference a database to check the user
- Post: Uploads entry to database
	- Flask form to collect data
	- Sqlite to store data
- Database: stores different entriess for the wiki
	- Easiest way would be to have one table with usernames and passwords
	- 2nd table could store text entries, each tied to a name
	- Both tables only have 2 fields
- Search: search for posts to the database
	- Flask form to collect input
	- Use SQLite to see if entry exists
	- If it does, direct to page
	- If it doesn't, stay on home page
- Content page: presents info
	- Auto generated page, using task template and retrieved data from the data base
	- Can also have links to other relevent posts, which point back to the data base
	and generate a new content page
	- Links may need to be generated in with flask code
- Also home page can be accessed from any page on the site
