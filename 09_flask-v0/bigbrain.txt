Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
This is similar to how objects are initialized in Java.

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
'/' is used in the paths of directories. It separates different folders and files. 
It is also used in web adresses to indicate the path of a page. 

Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
This will print to the terminal. It will print the app variable because it is initialized using '__name__'?

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
It will not appear anywhere because the print method is not used and the function is not called again.

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
This is like calling an objects method in java. I don't think i have ever used a 'run()' method, though.

Notes:
After running the app, it prints in the terminal
"
 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.

 It seems like it set up a web server.
 When I go to the web address, it says "No hablo queso!".
